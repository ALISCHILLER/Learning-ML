1
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,136
"Any Guy" playing...

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,337
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,021
Come on. She needs us.

4
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,857
Let's go inside.

5
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,778
So they found him,
crashed up against the tree.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,764
He was cold.

7
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,033
Dead for hours.

8
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,535
Dead for hours, Eva.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,692
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,652
Grace, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,988
- What happened?
- We don't fucking know.

12
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,697
Sorry.

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,659
- Do you want some tea, Urs?
- No, she doesn't want tea.

14
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,161
She doesn't... Someone should make you tea.

15
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,181
- Becka, the...
- No! I'm fucking listening.

16
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,875
Go on, Grace.

17
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,437
We had my birthday dinner.

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,773
And it was lovely.

19
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,319
So I said, "Let's have an early night."

20
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,071
And he just got so angry with me.

21
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,352
So, he left. Went off on the bike
to the pub to watch the match, so…

22
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,954
I just went to bed.

23
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,708
I was just…
…just so hurt.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,090
It was my birthday,
and I just wanted to be with my husband.

25
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,828
- I didn't know why he'd do that to me.
- Just leave me like that.

26
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,138
Because he was a prick.

27
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,894
Hey.
Of course you were hurt, Gracie.

28
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,629
I'm so sorry.

29
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,732
How am I gonna tell Blanaid?

30
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,820
He's dead.

31
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,865
He's dead.

32
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,381
Oh, my God!

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,518
Oh, poor Gracie.

34
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,298
Oh, God, I don't know how to feel.

35
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,526
I do.

36
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,571
He saved us all a lot of hassle.

37
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,164
Ding-dong, the prick is dead.

38
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,661
Hey, hey. Is she okay?

39
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,288
What... W-What's happened?

40
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,474
She needs an emergency C-section.

41
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,460
They don't know if they'll…

42
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,171
Oh, Christ. I'll head over now.

43
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,715
No, no, I don't need you here.

44
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,109
- Have you a pen?
- Uh, yeah. Hang on.

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,278
Um…

46
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,407
Have you found a pen?

47
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,934
You sh...
You don't have a pen on your desk.

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,870
There'll be a pen there somewhere.

49
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,272
I-I can't find a pen.

50
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,565
Matt, there's pens.

51
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,901
Look, it's fine. I'll just... Just tell me.
I'll remember.

52
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,027
Fine!

53
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,446
I'm gonna be off radar
for I don't know how long.

54
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,323
Respond to anything in my in-box.

55
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,033
Post Malcolm Tunnoch his GAA tickets.

56
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,827
They're his "thank you" for getting me
the psychiatric report on Williams.

57
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,776
They're on the desk. You can't miss them.

58
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,416
Uh, okay, GAA tickets for Malcolm.

59
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,876
- Anything else?
- I don't know, Matt.

60
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,271
I mean, is there anything else you
can think of before it's all over for us?

61
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,066
Before I'm in a cell?

62
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,304
Before some man moves into my home?
Makes my family sever all contact with me.

63
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,640
Not even a wedding photo left on the…

64
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,017
- What are you talking about? What man?
- I don't know.

65
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,185
I couldn't sleep last night.

66
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,271
The future got very dark.
It got very specific.

67
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,024
Look, you're not going to jail,
Thomas, okay?

68
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,944
We know now for sure
Becka wasn't with her sisters.

69
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,612
It's too late for all that now.

70
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,697
We took our eye off the ball.
We should have done more.

71
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,034
We exhumed the body, Tom, for God...
Oh, shit!

72
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,202
Listen, I've gotta go.

73
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,080
Look, just...
Tom, don't worry. Tru... Please trust me.

74
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,141
I have everything under control.

75
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,740
Matt!

76
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,943
Why were you hiding behind your desk?

77
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,713
I wasn't. I was looking for a pen.

78
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,009
I thought you were ghosting me.

79
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,077
You didn't text me back yesterday.

80
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:56,433
No, um, no. Just, um, Thomas is actually...

81
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,502
- Thomas is in hospital.
- Oh, good.

82
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,672
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry.
That's... Is he okay?

83
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,426
Yeah, no, it's his, uh, his wife.
Their baby.

84
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,197
They have complications,
so I'm gonna head over there in a bit.

85
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,914
Um, so, yeah.

86
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,251
I will call you when I know more.

87
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:38,249
Becka, um, so I went to that pub
in Wick low where JP spent his last night.

88
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,853
And, um,
the barmaid said she saw you there.

89
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,151
So, you and your sisters
weren't together at all, were you?

90
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,096
Barmaid got it wrong.

91
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,447
Right.

92
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,661
How'd those postmortem results
work out for you?

93
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,622
Or did you get that wrong too?

94
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,033
Where the hell is Becka?

95
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,368
She's supposed to be here.

96
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,095
She'd better not be with Matt.

97
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,289
Surely she's not following her fanny
at a time like this?

98
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,478
Grace, you okay, honey? You all right?

99
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,397
His walking boots.

100
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,733
I broke these in for him.

101
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,193
I wore them around the house.

102
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,595
Oh, God.
He's only just been buried

103
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,283
and I'm… …boxing up
his life like he was never even here.

104
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,452
Oh, he was here all right.

105
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,913
Maybe these would suit Nora?

106
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,208
I don't remember what size she is.

107
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,151
I'm taking offense on Nora's behalf.

108
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,259
We're fucked.

109
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,138
One for Donal?
I think they had the same sense of humor.

110
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,474
Oh, Baby Becka.

111
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,793
Uh, Grace, uh,
we're gonna need more boxes, honey.

112
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,939
Uh, yeah. Hang on.
I'll just pop down to the utility.

113
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,134
This is nice.

114
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,762
I mean, this is awful.

115
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm packing up me dead husband's clothes,
but, you know.

116
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,564
I just came...

117
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,792
Just… …shut up. Get inside.

118
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,293
Get in.

119
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,035
Matt knows we weren't together
the night John Paul died.

120
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,245
- How the hell does he know that?
- Why were you with Matt?

121
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,915
I just found him hiding
in his fucking office.

122
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,918
- Oh, Christ. It's over.
- Hiding from me.

123
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,129
Look, first of all,
I've had men hide from me, okay?

124
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,173
- Just deal with it.
- He knows I've been lying, Eva.

125
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,008
No, listen, listen.

126
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,652
What if they're onto something?

127
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,555
They firmly believe that someone
was behind John Paul's death, okay?

128
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,118
What... What... What... What if they're
right? What if someone did kill him?

129
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,019
Wha...

130
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,080
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

131
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:10,276
We were just seeing if... if we could all
fit in your massive wardrobe.

132
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,796
Eat your heart out, Carrie Bradshaw.

133
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,782
Get in here! So big.

134
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,884
Honestly.

135
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,928
It's massive.

136
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,110
Why do we keep coming here
if there's no booze?

137
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,236
I fancy a soup.

138
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,655
No. No soup, no booze.

139
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,674
- I want your alibis.
- What?

140
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,634
Where did you all go that night?

141
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,636
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,621
I was with Ben. You know that.

143
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,541
Well, you could have done it together.
You've both plenty of reasons.

144
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,294
And where were you? Your head's been
all over the place since Minna.

145
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,604
Exactly.

146
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,882
The only one mental enough
to do anything on their own is you.

147
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,609
And everyone knows it.

148
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,220
Actually, Eva,
you said point-blank that you'd do it.

149
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,948
Yeah, well I didn't, okay?

150
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,892
What'd you do with the pen to anyway?

151
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,327
It's in my wash-bag.

152
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,895
Where's your wash-bag?

153
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,444
- It's at Ben's.
- It's at Be...

154
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,607
It's at Ben's?

155
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,233
But I haven't seen him.

156
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,711
Do you think he might be involved
in any way?

157
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,698
How? H-He somehow…
…drugged him and caused him to crash?

158
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,383
Mmm.

159
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,703
Oh, my God.

160
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,390
Just go to Ben's, get the pen to,
and then get back to mine.

161
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,792
Okay.

162
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,602
- Go!
- Okay.

163
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,145
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,107
And no sex.

165
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,976
Sorry I've not been around to see you.

166
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,582
Uh, it's just since, you know, JP died,
I needed to be there for Grace.

167
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,169
The insurance company
are still making it difficult for her.

168
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,004
They won't pay out.

169
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,951
They think there's foul play of some kind
in JP's death.

170
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,595
Wouldn't that be poetic.

171
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,016
Where did you go that night?

172
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,228
The night JP died,
you were gone when I woke up.

173
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,983
You stopped calling, and you're not
answering any of my text messages.

174
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,696
You once said that
you'd do anything for me.

175
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,657
You think I killed him?

176
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,309
I think people do crazy things
when they're in love.

177
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,395
I-I'd do the same.
I-I'd do anything for you.

178
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,833
Ah, you're so full of shit.

179
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,044
- No, I'm no... I'm...
- Come on, Urs.

180
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,757
You wouldn't even move into a house
that I wanted to rent for us.

181
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,177
Now, you say you'd kill for me? Come on.

182
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:13,001
It repulsed me.
What you asked me to do, it repulsed me.

184
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,086
I didn't ask you to do anything.

185
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,399
We both know
what you wanted me to do that night.

186
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,820
I had to leave that night

187
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,866
because I couldn't bear lying beside you
for another minute.

188
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,203
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,873
It's over.

190
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,877
Please.

191
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,300
I need this to be over, Urs.

192
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,052
Please.

193
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,110
Michael, no.

194
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,320
- No peeping. Think about it…
- Go!

195
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,841
- Dad…
- Don't, Michael!

196
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,221
Michael tried to soak me with the hose.
You'll be next.

197
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,124
You all right? Do you want a cup of tea?

198
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,910
Roger, is it? Matthew Claffin.

199
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,329
Do you mind if I come inside?

200
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:01,960
Um, yeah, okay.
Just go around to your left, yeah?

201
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,127
- Oh, please, sit down.
- Yeah. Thank you.

202
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,687
Sorry about the mess.

203
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,646
No, you're okay.

204
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:29,763
Um, so I'm dealing with the policy
of a local family, the Williams'.

205
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:34,242
Uh, just doing a bit of background work
before, uh... before we pay out.

206
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,828
It's standard procedure.

207
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,874
So, uh, you know the family?

208
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,667
Yeah, I did.

209
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,753
Not anymore?

210
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,880
Well, he's dead, isn't he?

211
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,091
He... He is.

212
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,678
Uh, but not Grace and Blanaid.

213
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,583
Yeah, well, it's too late now, isn't it?

214
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,562
What's... What's done is done.

215
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,357
That man was the devil incarnate.

216
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,635
He accused me of a crime so hateful.

217
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,028
Which crime?

218
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,139
Having an unnatural interest in children.

219
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,392
I've got nothing but love for children,
but he set the tongues wagging!

220
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,578
My church disowned me!

221
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,916
My duties were taken from me!
My life has fallen apart!

222
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,795
And all for sport. That's all it was.

223
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,756
Just amusement to him.

224
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,910
Um, can I ask you a question?

225
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:39,599
Um, can you remember where you were
the night John Paul died?

226
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,145
Yeah.

227
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,732
I went up to his cabin
the night that he died.

228
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,009
'Cause I knew I couldn't carry around

229
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,929
all this hatred
that was inside me, you see?

230
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,031
I knew I needed to forgive him.

231
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,161
I knew I needed to get back
to the love, you see?

232
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:06,001
You went to the cabin and...
And John Paul was there?

233
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,338
Pay the woman's claim.

234
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,882
It's the least she deserves

235
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:17,094
after all these years spent
with that twisted bastard.

236
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:23,142
I'll tell you what's unnatural,
the interest he had in his sisters-in-law.

237
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,811
What do you mean?

238
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,732
I'd like you to leave now, please.

239
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,278
Sure.

240
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,412
Mrs. Williams!

241
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,898
Grace!

242
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,232
Some news, I hope.

243
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,569
- Yeah, well, sort of. Can I come in?
- No.

244
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,839
Sorry, no, I have Blanaid's dinner
to get started, so…

245
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,534
Okay, um, I'm just still a little fuzzy
on a couple of things

246
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,512
I wanted to quickly go over.

247
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,580
So, I went to that pub in Wick low.

248
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:04,292
Barmaid said she can't be sure
your husband was there or not.

249
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,419
All I know
is he said he went to watch Harps play.

250
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,089
And if that's what he said,
then that's what he would have done.

251
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,424
Okay. She said Becka, um...

252
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,486
Your sister, Rebecca,
that she was there, though.

253
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,098
So, not with you all as you said.

254
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,351
She came late.
She's always late.

255
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,329
Your neighbor said
your husband accused him of pedophilia.

256
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,459
He said he went to the cabin that night
to forgive him. Did you see him there?

257
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,279
Your younger sister said
that he financially ruined her,

258
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,549
and he was abusive to his own mother.

259
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,137
He wasn't a popular man, was he?

260
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,350
God's sake.

261
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,474
Ow!

262
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,855
Ah, shit.

263
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,444
Oh, for God's sake.

264
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,164
Leave a message for Thomas Claffin.

265
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:59,944
Thomas, Grace told me JP was going
to the pub to watch the match,

266
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,756
but the match was the night after.
It was the Saturday.

267
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,451
I just checked those tickets for Malcolm,
those fixtures are always on a Saturday.

268
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,262
JP definitely lied to her.

269
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,265
Why would he lie?

270
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,392
Where the hell have you been?

271
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,754
Oh, no, take your time, Urs.

272
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,482
It's only our entire lives
on the line here.

273
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,156
Ben didn't do it.

274
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:14,202
What did he do with the pen to?
Have you got it?

275
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,483
How can you be sure he didn't?

276
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,919
'Cause he ended it, Bibi, okay?
That's how.

277
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,090
He wouldn't do that for me.
I don't know what I was thinking.

278
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,219
I've ruined it all.

279
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,181
Oh, Urs.

280
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,268
Okay, if anyone in this room did it,
we need to say.

281
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,562
I mean it.

282
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,381
No one is gonna have
to deal with this alone.

283
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,318
We'll... We'll close ranks, circle in.

284
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,945
It's the only way we can all be protected.

285
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,200
Urs.

286
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,912
She was on her own all night.

287
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,938
- Who's to say she didn't?
- 'Cause I didn't.

288
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,857
- Because she didn't.
- Oh, okay.

289
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,650
So, both of you get
automatically believed,

290
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,237
- and I have to provide a bloody alibi?
- She didn't have someone else involved.

291
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,072
She's a fucking psycho!

292
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:12,035
I'm not the one who tried to kill someone
so my husband didn't discover my affair.

293
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,330
- Oh, you f... Bitch.
- Look, just stop! Okay? Just stop.

294
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,415
- You're the psycho!
- Where were you, Becka?

295
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,543
I need to know where you were that night.
Why was there mud on your shoes?

296
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,838
I got hammered at the pub!
Miss fucking Marple.

297
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,007
I was worried
you would do something reckless,

298
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,302
- so I got pissed. You taught me well.
- Don't talk to her like that!

299
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,279
What are you fighting about?

300
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:35,784
Um, nothing. Uh, just politics.

301
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,727
Ever since John Paul died,

302
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,288
whenever I walk into the room,
you stop talking.

303
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,856
No, we don't!

304
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,750
What's happened, Grace? You okay?

305
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,128
They did a postmortem on John Paul.

306
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,589
My signature is on this
like I agreed to it.

307
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,260
- Those dirty bastards.
- Shut up.

308
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,554
Oh, my God.

309
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,852
You knew about it.
You knew about the postmortem.

310
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,732
Why did they exhume John Paul's body?

311
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,824
Because they think he was murdered.

312
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,756
And they think
it was one of us who did it.

313
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,833
One of you?

314
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,586
Why would they think that?

315
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:33,049
Because they think
we all had reason to kill him.

316
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,161
- And because...
- No! Just...

317
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,804
Stop lying to her!

318
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,267
Because we may not have killed him…

319
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,229
Jesus, we tried.

320
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,466
What are you talking about?
What does that mean? "We tried"?

321
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,487
We wanted John Paul dead, Gracie.

322
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,783
We were doing it for you.

323
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,452
We wanted to save you.

324
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,207
We wanted you and Blanaid to be free.

325
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,963
Gracie.

326
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,935
I'm so sorry.

327
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm so, so sorry.

328
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,972
- There you go.
- It was my birthday.

329
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,933
We were having a lovely evening…

330
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,622
Come on, you.

331
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:50,985
Ooh.

332
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:54,114
These stairs are slippery, Mammy.

333
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:56,241
Very slippery.

334
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,844
We need to do something
about these stairs.

335
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:02,431
- What are you looking for, honey?
- Jam-jams.

336
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,031
You could go without them, maybe?

337
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,770
Just for tonight.

338
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,441
That tickles, Mam.

339
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,884
Well, then…

340
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,529
I'll just have to be more careful,
won't I?

341
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,012
Tell me it's just you and me.

342
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,057
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

343
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,098
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

344
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:11,126
Are you trying to break my neck?
Don't do that.

345
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,294
- John Paul.
- No, no, I'm... I'm... I'm...

346
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,148
I'm not doing this now.

347
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:22,195
Oh! Here we go, the dramatic tear fall.

348
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,725
I just... I just wanted to kiss you, baby.
I just want...

349
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,645
N-No. No, no, no,
you don't just want to kiss, Grace.

350
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,082
You always want something more.
The... The pressure you put on me is…

351
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,671
Ursula says it's... it's so normal. Y...

352
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,909
There are loads of reasons for impotence,
like, uh...

353
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:48,096
Have you talked to your sisters
about my cock?

354
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,974
Ursula's a nurse.

355
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,917
- She's used to talking about...
- She's a whore!

356
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,227
I beg your pardon?

357
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,549
Your sisters are poison, Grace.
And they poison your mind.

358
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,277
Why do you keep talking about my sisters?

359
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:07,432
- I'm just trying to help fix a problem.
- Who are you to fix anything anyway?

360
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,808
I mean, you're nothing.

361
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,187
You're a fly on a wall. You're a shadow.

362
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:16,191
If I turn out that light right now,
you wouldn't even exist.

363
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,876
You wanna try it?

364
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,005
You wanna try that? See what happens?

365
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:23,507
Here we go.

366
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:28,453
Hello? Mammy? Where's Mammy?
Has anyone seen Mammy?

367
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,556
See? You're not even a shadow anymore.

368
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,019
Ah! There you are.

369
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,313
You're back. Mammy's back.

370
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,273
You exist again.

371
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,613
Where are you going? I dare you to say it.

372
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,366
I'm going to my sisters.

373
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:53,895
You just won't see it, will you?
Your sisters are the problem!

374
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,730
They're the only ones
who actually care about me.

375
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,274
Well, they will do anything
to pull us apart.

376
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,527
That's how much they care about you.

377
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,945
- Do you wanna talk about this?
- No!

378
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,798
Do you want to know why
I have issues getting it up with you?

379
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,512
Because one of
your precious sisters seduced me,

380
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,372
that's why.

381
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,890
What are you talking about?

382
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,436
Seduced you?
What does that even mean?

383
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,296
When I was drunk.

384
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,149
Which sister, John Paul? Who?

385
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,025
Eva.

386
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,553
Eva?

387
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,863
Yes.

388
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,825
No, she wouldn't. I don't...

389
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,479
You had sex with Eva?

390
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,583
Grace, that was not sex.

391
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,544
That was a trap.

392
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,296
When?

393
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,798
Years ago. Ten years ago.

394
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,702
That Ciaran fellow, he'd passed out,
you'd fallen asleep,

395
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:54,181
and... and she came onto me.

396
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:58,251
And I was out of my mind drunk,
and... and I think I thought it was you,

397
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,979
and then she tricked me, and it...

398
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:05,609
It's messed me up.
It's messed me up ever since.

399
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:11,364
So it was when
we came up here for my birthday?

400
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,743
And she's even tried to blame me
for what happened after.

401
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,369
For what?

402
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,581
- The miscarriage?
- Yes.

403
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,735
But I was with her when that happened.
She was destroyed.

404
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,755
Yeah, well, whatever happened,
it was her fault.

405
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:31,968
She was filthy drunk, Grace.
That's how you lose a baby.

406
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:36,790
What did you do?

407
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,100
What?

408
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,168
What did you make her do?

409
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,961
Look at me!

410
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,089
Don't you fucking scream at me!

411
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,441
Don't!

412
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,362
It was her! Your sister!

413
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,114
You're a liar.

414
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,790
She's the liar here. She blamed me.

415
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:06,878
She even tried to say that I raped her
'cause she was so disgusted with herself.

416
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,405
Did you rape her, John Paul?

417
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,886
Did I rape her? No.
You don't rape women like that.

418
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,168
- Get off me! You liar!
- Mammy. Ma...

419
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,063
Everything you do,
everything we have is a lie!

420
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:32,904
You ruined her life,
you fucking monster!

421
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,254
Grace.

422
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,022
You blamed me!

423
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,527
You made me think it was me!

424
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,535
You fucking monster.

425
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,800
I didn't do what he said I did.

426
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,611
- Course you didn't.
- I didn't do it.

427
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,598
- I re... I was drunk.
- I was.

428
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:44,060
And I really thought, you know,
I really thought, "Did I do something?"

429
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,145
But…

430
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:48,248
I... I remember going to the bathroom.

431
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,067
And I remember
not being able to lock the door.

432
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,028
And I... I passed out,
or I couldn't get up, or something,

433
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,382
and... and then... and then I looked up,
and he was there.

434
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,010
And he was looking down at me.

435
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,221
And I remember I smi... I smiled at him,
but just...

436
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:05,974
Thought he was trying to help me.

437
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,895
But he...

438
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,884
- But I didn't do anything. I didn't.
- No.

439
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:18,470
I couldn't stop him

440
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:21,055
because... because I just...
I... because I couldn't.

441
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,532
Listen to me.

442
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,410
I know that he raped you.

443
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,584
I didn't know I was pregnant.

444
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:39,216
I didn't even think I could…
…get so…

445
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,745
But when I miscarried, I tho... I th...
I just thought it was a punishment for it.

446
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,769
Don't.

447
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,734
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,339
Whatever you're blaming yourself for,
it's not your fault.

449
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,824
Either of you.

450
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,510
Oh.

451
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,059
How did you, uh…

452
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,339
How did you know what to do with his body?

453
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,797
You buried him in the murder weapon.

454
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,217
- How do you mean?
- His pajamas.

455
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,260
Sorry.

456
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,413
How did you keep it to yourself
for so long, Gracie?

457
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,233
Why did you never tell me what happened?

458
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:11,154
Oh, I was going to. I w... I was. I was
going to tell you the next morning, just…

459
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,616
The moment I didn't,
I... I knew I never would.

460
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,521
It's Matt.

461
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,232
Answer it.

462
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,045
Hello?

463
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,880
I need to see you.

464
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,324
Ah… …that's nice.

465
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:34,828
Um, I'm a bit busy now.

466
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,056
I've been to the cabin in Wick low.
I know what happened to JP.

467
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,913
- Becka?
- Wait…

468
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,489
Well?

469
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,352
What did he say?

470
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:02,539
He was at the cabin.
He wants to meet up with me.

471
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,292
So what does he know?

472
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,462
I guess that's what I'll find out.

473
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,409
- I can't go to prison. I can't do that.
- I can't...

474
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,870
I can't leave Blanaid on her own.
I can't do that.

475
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,788
For God's sake,
surely we just explain what he did.

476
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,915
The rape, the abuse.

477
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,542
I mean, he's pushed us all over the edge.

478
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,711
Yeah, let's try that,
'cause that always works for women.

479
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,130
- I...
- Where you going?

480
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,524
Uh, I have to take
Blanaid to her swimming.

481
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,343
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

482
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,220
What?
You think if we sit here long enough,

483
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,574
we're just gonna figure it out
like a bloody crossword puzzle?

484
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,312
I have to be a mother to my daughter
for as long as I can be.

485
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:45,148
Okay. You can go. You can go.

486
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,377
- It's okay.
- You can go.

487
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:50,945
- Love you, Gracie.
- I love you too.

488
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:52,255
I love you.

489
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,424
We're here, okay?

490
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,794
I have to go meet Matt, so…

491
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,983
Yeah. I'm... I'm gonna come with you.

492
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,689
Can you just let me do this?

493
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,694
Okay.

494
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,328
She took your jacket.

495
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,247
I know.

496
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,371
- Whatever you're thinking...
- Becka.

497
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:42,681
It was me.

498
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,960
I killed him. I did it.

499
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:49,020
I know why you're saying that.

500
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,108
- And I also know that you're lying.
- I did it, Matt.

501
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,197
Why are you punishing yourself like this?

502
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:03,435
If I mean anything to you…

503
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,104
…then keep what you found out to yourself.
Please.

504
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,523
You're asking me to choose you
over my brother.

505
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,125
He was an abuser.

506
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,278
He was a rapist. He raped my sister.

507
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:17,799
- He ruined our lives.
- And Grace killed him. She murdered him.

508
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,469
You and your sisters covered it up.

509
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:28,226
My mouth is so dry.
I can't swallow.

510
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,439
I need a drink or something.

511
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,989
Do you, uh…

512
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:45,185
Do you want a hot-water bottle, or...

513
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,495
Why?

514
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,207
Well…

515
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,919
I just thought with...

516
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:58,965
Oh. Yeah, well, it was ten years ago.

517
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:03,303
I mean, hot-water bottles are great,
but that might be a stretch.

518
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:10,143
I can't find my wash-bag.
I thought I left it on the table.

519
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,378
It has the pen to in it.

520
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:13,897
Did you do something with it?

521
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,691
Yeah, Ursula. I put it on my cornflakes.

522
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,134
Well, did you take it?

523
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,278
No. What?

524
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,699
Oh, my God.

525
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,603
Becka...
Becka, I'm on my way to you now.

526
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,022
Please, please don't do anything stupid.

527
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:31,981
Get in the back.

528
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,942
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Drive, Eva!

529
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:35,318
I am!

530
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:38,505
- Drive, drive!
- Just hand her the bloody seat belt.

531
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,982
Shit, shit, shit.

532
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,443
Shit.

533
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,721
I love you.

534
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,668
You shouldn't say
something that you don't mean.

535
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,270
But I do.

536
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,232
I love you. That's the truth.

537
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,031
I'm sorry, Becka.

538
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,273
Just go. Please.

539
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:43,797
Oh, my God, I'm stuck.
I'm stuck!

540
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,407
- Wait!
- No, don't wait!

541
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:47,492
Come on!

542
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:49,921
- Press the button!
- I'm pressing it!

543
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:57,018
Becka. What are you doing?

544
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,839
What the fuck?
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

545
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,384
I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

546
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:08,697
- I couldn't do it.
- Stop, stop, stop. Stop. It's okay.

547
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:11,474
I killed her.

548
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,642
Listen. Listen to me.

549
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:15,228
Whatever happens next,
you have to forgive yourself, Becka.

550
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,914
You have to. You have to forgive yourself.

551
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:20,442
It's okay, it's okay. She's okay.

552
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,026
Yeah, well, she won't be in a minute.

553
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,987
You almost gave us a heart attack!

554
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,781
Where is he? Becka, where has he gone?

555
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:32,220
He knows Grace killed him
and thinks we covered it up.

556
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,874
Well…

557
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,084
Well, ma-maybe there's
a-a-a way around this.

558
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,086
Um, diminished responsibility, o-or...

559
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,856
Whatever happens to Grace,
we covered up a murder…

560
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:47,527
I think that's frowned on
in certain circles.

561
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,655
Yeah, you know what else is frowned on
in certain circles?

562
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,659
Faking signatures.
Illegally exhuming bodies.

563
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,729
All we tried to do
was kill that fucker a few times.

564
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,039
Bibi…

565
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,505
So, what are you gonna do?

566
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,004
Fuck!

567
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:38,223
I've a daughter. I'm a father, Matt.
I'm a... I'm a da... I'm a daddy.

568
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,287
How are the girls?

569
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,631
Yeah,
the little one's out of intensive care,

570
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:50,026
and Theresa asked me to go to AbraKebabra
to get an all-meat kebab,

571
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,135
so that's a good sign. I think.

572
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,547
Could be ominous.

573
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,216
We don't have to pay out
the Williams claim, Tom.

574
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,136
What? What do you mean?

575
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:04,516
Grace Williams. She's withdrawn the claim.

576
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,878
- Well, how the hell did you do that, Matt?
- It doesn't matter.

577
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,672
It does matter!
Well, of course, it matters!

578
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,632
You had your secrets, okay?

579
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:15,093
Didn't seem to bother you
that I was in the dark.

580
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:19,823
In fact, I'm pretty sure you said
it was for my own good. Well, so is this.

581
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:27,272
You clever little bastard.

582
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:33,628
Ah!

583
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,180
Blanaid, you look beautiful.

584
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,790
Maybe put on a coat, though?

585
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:47,259
See you later, Mam.

586
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,878
Text me.

587
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:51,354
Mam, I'll see you later.

588
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:55,150
Bla, I love you.

589
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,936
I love you too, Mam.

590
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,688
Mmm. Have fun.

591
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,292
- Bla, hurry up!
- Coming!

592
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,972
Blink of an eye and she's all grown up.

593
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:30,936
Well, a lot has happened.
That's sure to change you.

594
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,023
I see you're moving on.

595
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,443
We have no choice.
Can't afford to stay here.

596
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:42,222
We're gonna live with Eva. A widow
and a spinster, living it up. Whoo-hoo!

597
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:46,976
Before we leave, I wanted to...

598
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,938
Please. Grace, don't.

599
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:53,208
I never did thank you for what you did.

600
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,068
You can't thank me for that.

601
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:57,320
If I had opened my eyes
to what was going on,

602
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,631
if I'd just seen what he was doing to you,

603
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,843
it would never have come to that.

604
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,724
I wish I hadn't asked you for your help…

605
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:10,434
…but what you did,

606
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,395
that was a good thing.

607
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,951
Don't forget about me.

608
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:29,953
I won't.

609
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,077
Bring your own then!

610
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,490
Are you trying to will
that dick in the Speedo's to fall in?

611
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:27,219
No. I will now, though.

612
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,305
You all right?

613
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,459
Hola, chicas!

614
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,002
- Hola!
- Hello.

615
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,087
Finally.

616
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,547
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, I had a business meeting.

617
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:40,840
- Dirt bird.
- Shut up.

618
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:42,926
All right, you mad cow.

619
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,636
All right, you mad bitch.

620
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,180
Man, I missed that laugh.

621
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:49,825
I didn't realize how much.

622
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:54,538
You're only as happy
as your unhappiest child.

623
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,374
And she's grand now.

624
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:03,130
- Oi! Are we getting in or what?
- Go on then.

625
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,133
- Yes! Come on. Took her time.
- Oh.

626
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,804
God. A voluntary hug.

627
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:17,894
Oh, thank you, Gracie.

628
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:23,108
Look at you. Bloody wet suit.

629
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,235
- Bitch.
- I came prepared!

630
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,117
- Come on, Grace!
- Get in! Come on!

631
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,411
- Come on!
- Get in!

632
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,972
- Oi!
- Come on!

633
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,082
Come on, Grace! Do it!

634
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,500
What are you waiting for?

635
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,489
- Get in!
- Come on, Grace.

636
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,649
- Whoo!
- Whoa!
